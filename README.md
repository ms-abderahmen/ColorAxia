# ColorAxia

This is my first, and biggest, project I have done using Unity. I made this game a month after I started learning Unity. The graphics and animations aren't that good since I'm not so good at design and 3D modeling, but I tried to make something playable at least.
My main goal for this project was to make it an online moblie game. I made it to the point where the online function works, but it was so laggy, since I was new to Unity and online development back then.
